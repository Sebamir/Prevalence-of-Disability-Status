# Prevalence of Disability Status

This project analyzes the **prevalence of disability** across different population groups, aiming to understand its distribution and support decision-making in inclusion and public health policies.

## Objectives
- Identify the distribution of disability across demographic groups.
- Quantify prevalence by type of disability.
- Generate insights to guide public health policies and inclusion programs.

## Dataset
Disability and Health Data System (DHDS) is an online source of state-level data on adults with disabilities. Users can access information on six functional disability types: 
cognitive (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions), hearing (serious difficulty hearing or deaf), mobility (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs), 
vision (serious difficulty seeing), self-care (difficulty dressing or bathing) and independent living (difficulty doing errands alone).

## Analysis
The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Visualization of disability distribution
- Calculation of prevalence by population group
- Identification of relevant patterns and trends

## Technologies
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel
